# Coordinating a workshop in three steps

There is a lot to consider when coordinating a workshop.  This checklist is for keeping you on track so that workshop planning, execution, and follow-up are as stress-free as possible.

The checklist lists the milestones you may want to work towards when coordinating a workshop as well as tips for staying on track.

## Step 1 - Understand what running a workshop entails
Before you begin preparing for your workshop make sure you have the basic ingredients covered:
Workshop material 
A target audience
A basic understanding of the workshop coordinating process. Have a look at the general tips below as a starting point.

General tips:
If you are unfamiliar with running a workshop start planning at least 3 months in advance. 
Schedule a weekly 15 min time slot in your calendar for checking this document.  Short, consistent check-ins are much more useful than sporadic marathon meetings.
If possible, co-coordinate your workshop with someone else.  Working with someone else will make it more likely that you hit your milestones.
Do a dry run.  Before your workshop, have a practice session.  This is for checking timing, making sure your technology works, finding bugs, and familiarising yourself with the content.  Book this in your calendar early on and stick to it.
Coordinating a workshop is a group effort.  Step one should always be getting help and clarifying who is responsible for what. Specifically you will need to fill the following roles (people can, of course, fill multiple roles):
Lead instructor(s)
Co-instructor(s)
Workshop Coordinator
Workshop helpers
Technical support
Coordination support

## Step 2 - Form a workshop team
Fill out the ‘Who’ column in the table below before planning your workshop.  This will help you determine who will be doing what and whether you have enough support to move forward with the planning process.
